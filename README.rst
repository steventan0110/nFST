Sequence Models with Latent Variables
====================================

nFST (neuralized finite state transducer) is a sequence modeling toolkit
that allows users to define their own latent variable models (with help of finite state machines) to
train sequence models. Using FST to represent latent structure is a generic approach that
can be applied to various tasks including transliteration, slot filtering (tagging), cipher decoding, etc.
The formalism is described in the `thesis <xx>`_.
